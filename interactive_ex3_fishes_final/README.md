Moving forward to explore the translation of fish scientific names to their common names in our next visualisation, we bridge the gap between technical nomenclature and everyday terminology, this enhancement aims to make the information more accessible and relatable for a wider audience. It would allow readers not only to understand species distributions but also to associate these findings with familiar species they may already recognize, further enriching the context and usability of the visualization.

The word map is a dynamic visualization that classifies fish species by their native oceans and archetypes, such as predators, scavengers, or reef dwellers, while translating their scientific names into common names for accessibility. Organized into distinct regions, the map highlights the biodiversity of aquatic life in each ocean, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It bridges scientific taxonomy and practical understanding, showcasing the relationships between species, their ecological roles, and geographic distribution.
