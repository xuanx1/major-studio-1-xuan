Sample GUI superimposed on the current SI website:

Fishes thumbnails(currently depicted by vector placeholders fishes) from NMNH Fish database will be arranged according to the depth(m) field stated on each specimen/lot - the greater the depth, the lower the position of the image on the webpage - to see deepsea fishes, one has to scroll almost infinitely down.

Next step for prototype: run json through sorting function and load it on page length as y axis = "depth" and for x axis use math.random to position png files of fish thumbnails on the page width to ensure they are not lined up in the same x axis and hence look more like a natural cross-section of an ocean.
