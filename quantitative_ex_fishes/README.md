Sample GUI superimposed on the current SI website:

Fishes thumbnails(currently depicted by vector placeholders fishes) from NMNH Fish database will be arranged according to the depth(m) field stated on each specimen/lot - the greater the depth, the lower the position of the image on the webpage - to see deepsea fishes, one has to scroll almost infinitely down.

Next step for prototype: run json through sorting function and load it on page length as "depth"
