## Interactivity

This lab demonstrates filter, select, and hover behavior with a  D3 visualization. This also shows how to use a `state` variable to keep track of your data.

### App Architecture + State Schema

### Activity 1: Pseudo code
- Let's look at the final result
- Let's write pseudo code. What actually has to happen here?
- Let's turn that into functions
- What are the states the visualization?


### Activity 2: Code analysis 
- First get an overview of everything
- Do a close read of each function
  - What is contained in the state object?
  - When and how often are these functions called: dataLoad(), onCheckboxChange(), onMouseEvent(), initializeLayout(), draw()  
- Describe to the class
